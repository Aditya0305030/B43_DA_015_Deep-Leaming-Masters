# Warfare Losses: Analyzing the 2022 Conflict

## 📚 Project Overview
This project analyzes the 2022 Ukraine-Russia conflict by exploring military equipment losses. The objective is to identify trends, explore directions with the greatest losses, and analyze daily equipment losses using a well-structured dataset. The project also includes SQL integration for querying the data and a Power BI dashboard for interactive visualization.

## 📊 Dataset Information
- **Dataset Name:** war_equipment.csv
- **Source:** Open-source data collected from verified sources.
- **Description:** The dataset includes information on destroyed, damaged, and captured military equipment, categorized by asset type and loss direction.
- **Columns Include:**
  - Date
  - Equipment_Type
  - Losses
  - Loss_Direction
  - Country

## 🔥 Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection:** Acquired verified data on military equipment losses.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Processed missing values and handled inconsistencies.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identified trends and patterns using statistical summaries and visualizations.
4. **SQL Database Integration:** Stored cleaned data in a SQL database with optimized queries.
5. **Dashboard Development:** Built an interactive Power BI dashboard for visualization.
6. **Result Interpretation:** Analyzed results and summarized key insights.

## 📈 Key Insights
- Directional analysis highlights areas of intense conflict.
- Daily trends indicate peak loss periods and types of assets affected.
- Equipment types most affected include armored vehicles, tanks, and aircraft.

## 🗄️ SQL Database Setup
- **SQL File:** sql file of cw.sql
